# Practical Tarot Reading

Practical Tarot Reading uses the 22 Major Arcana to answer questions just like a traditional reading, but better. Our shuffling algorithm guarantees a completely random shuffling. In other words, it's impossible to know how the cards will be presented on the screen, and that's what makes this app so accurate.

*Three or five-card spread.  
*Cards chosen by the user are shown on the screen in the order they were selected, from left to right.  
*Includes instructions on how to make better questions to get better answers from the oracle.
