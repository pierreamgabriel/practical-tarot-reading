# Practical Tarot Reading

Read Tarot without a physical deck. Practical Tarot Reading uses the 22 Major Arcana to answer questions just like a traditional reading, but better. Our shuffling algorithm guarantees a completely random shuffling, in other words, it's impossible to predict or control how the cards will be presented on the screen, and that's what makes this app 100% accurate.

*Two spread modes available: 3 or 5 cards.
*The cards chosen by the user are shown on the screen in the order they were selected, from left to right.
*Includes instructions on how to make better questions in order to get better answers from the oracle.
